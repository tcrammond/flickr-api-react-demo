# flickr-api-demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Consumes the public Flickr API and displays some photos, with a facility to search by tags.

## Set up

Install dependencies

`npm install`

Acquire a Flickr API key.

## Development

Run `REACT_APP_FLICKR_API_KEY=your-key-here npm run start`.

## Build / production mode

Run `REACT_APP_FLICKR_API_KEY=your-key-here npm run build`.

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
